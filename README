Sarafonts
A freely-available and free-to-use collection of hand-made bitmap fonts in various sizes.

Sara Mono Zero - A square, angular monospaced ASCII (127 char) font in 8x8, 16x16, and 32x32 sizes.
This is the font that I use in some of my JS experiments.
The 32x32 version might have some weird thickness issues, if you notice any please tell me.
